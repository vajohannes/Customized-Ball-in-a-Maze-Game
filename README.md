# Customized-Ball-in-a-Maze-Game
The goal of the game is to move the blocks to the targets.
In each step, you can only move one block, and the selected block will go straight in one direction to reach the end of the path before blocking by walls or other blocks.
The selected block will escape the map if there is a target along the path.
* represents the target
. represents an empty cell
# represents a wall cell
A-Z represents a movable block.
Block movement : 3 chars (including space)
First char represents the movable block in capital letter.
Second char is a space
Third char is the direction ( s for south, e for east, w for west, and n for north )
! ! is a special case to indicate the end of block movement.
For example, A e means move block A 1 step to the east.
